      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Benchmarks Report is a deep dive into how and why Voltron Data does benchmarking differently, and presents data comparing compute performance of our engine, Theseus, to Spark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I led the development of the report, which involved industry/market research, subject matter expert interviews with engineers, and cross-functional strategic storytelling alignment with founders. I also drove the development of the interactive data visualizations, which were created by the talented 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.tanyashapiro.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Tanya Shapiro&lt;/a&gt;. This report defined our first feature launch for the Theseus engine in spring 2024, announced at Nvidia&amp;rsquo;s GTC conference.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Composable Codex is a 5-part guide to building composable data systems layer by layer with open standards like Apache Arrow. I researched, wrote, and designed the Codex as part of my role on Voltron Data&amp;rsquo;s Go-To-Market Strategy team. This initiative was the onramp to our first product launch for the Theseus engine in fall 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
