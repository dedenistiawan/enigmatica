      <description>&lt;p&gt;Notebooks hold a special place in every data scientist&amp;rsquo;s heart. They may treasure every moment creating their own, or commenting on others&amp;rsquo; notebooks. Or they may sincerely and truly hate notebooks. But notebooks are useful. How could we &amp;ldquo;imagineer&amp;rdquo; better notebooks? Iâ€™ve made and read hundreds of notebooks in the past decade. In this talk, I share key principles for developing happier notebooks â€“ ones that are more fun to write, more fun to read, and more fun as an onramp to the next ride.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The untold story of palmerpenguins</title>
      <link>http://localhost:4321/talk/2022-user-penguins/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;palmerpenguins&lt;/strong&gt; R package provides a modern, approachable dataset containing body size measurements for three penguin species that nest on islands throughout the Palmer Archipelago, Western Antarctic Peninsula. Since &lt;strong&gt;palmerpenguins&lt;/strong&gt; was released on the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) in July 2020, the package has been downloaded over 340,000 times, was quickly adapted for use in other languages including Python&amp;rsquo;s seaborn package and Google&amp;rsquo;s TensorFlow datasets, and has become a go-to option for data science and statistics educators worldwide. In this talk, we share the untold story of the &lt;strong&gt;palmerpenguins&lt;/strong&gt; package. From original data collection on rocky Antarctic shores to CRAN submission and beyond, we describe the penguins&amp;rsquo; journey from polar research project to global teaching product. What started out as a simple methods paper for a dissertation project turned into a widely used data science product mainly because of initial efforts to make the data publicly available and easily accessible by others. The success of the &lt;strong&gt;palmerpenguins&lt;/strong&gt; R package underscores the importance of proper data archiving for unknown future applications.&lt;/p&gt;
