  Currently, I work as a lecturer and data analyst. As an educator, I have a passion for sharing knowledge and inspiring students in understanding the world of data and technology. On the other hand, as a data analyst, I am actively involved in various data analysis projects that aim to transform raw data into valuable insights that can be implemented in strategic decision making. 
  <br><br>Through this blog, I hope to share knowledge, experiences, and interesting findings about data mining, data analysis, and the academic world. I am also open to collaborating with professionals, researchers, and practitioners in the field of data science to jointly develop innovative solutions that can have a positive impact on society and industry.
